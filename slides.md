- Run `npm install` in the root of the project
- Run `npm run start` in the root of the project to spin up the server
- The html, css is already written for this project
- Complete the index.js and movie.js files to create a functioning app


---

# Overview of the app

- The app loads in all the movies from a remote server

- It puts the elements together and finally shows in in the dom by adding it to the element with id: `list`
- The html of 1 movie should look like this:

```html
<a href="/movie?movieId=87849b25-febf-4086-9616-9a332c18afc8">
  <div class="movieBox">
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYzZTBhYjktZTRhOC00ZDBkLTg4Y2MtZmIwMGQwZTNiMmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjM0MTI4Mw@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1125_.jpg">

# Cinema: Part 5, Liking a movie

- Create a function: `setLikedIcon` this function gets the parameter `isLiked`
  - Based on this parameter the className of the `movieLikeIcon` will be updated

- Create a function: `getMovieIsLikedForId` with parameter `movieId`
  - This functions returns a boolean based on if the `movieId` was in localStorage
- When the page loads in the correct functions should be called to show the icon in the correct state
- When the icon button is clicked the state should be updated using these functions

[Solution - movie.js](/cinema/part5.js)

- Call the `getHeartIcon` function in the `addMovieToDOM` function so the `i` element can be added to the DOM like this:
```html
<div class="movieBox">
  <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYzZTBhYjktZTRhOC00ZDBkLTg4Y2MtZmIwMGQwZTNiMmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjM0MTI4Mw@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1125_.jpg">
  <div>

- All results in localStorage are divided by a comma. Make sure this also works when localStorage is empty
- Call these function after the `rollDice` function and pass the result along
- Create a function `loadSavedResults` that is called when the page is loaded
- This functions gets the array of results from localStorage and uses `addResult` to show them to the user

[Solution](/dices/part2.js)

---

# Dices: Part3, Add names

- Create a function: `getStoredNames`
- This function gets all the names from localStorage divided by a comma and returns it as an array
- When localStorage is empty it should return an empty array
- Create a function: `onAddName` that is called when the add button is clicked
- It reads the name from the input and clears the input
- Get the other names with the `getStoredNames` function
- Add the new name to the list and save it in localStorage
- Show the names of the players in the playersText element add `Players: ` before the names and show them separated with a comma
- Create a function `loadSavedNames` that is called when the page is loaded

- When there are no names the text `Add players` should be shown instead

[Solution](/dices/part3.js)

---

# Dices: Part4, Show current player

- Create a function: `showNextPlayer`

- Increase the index, make sure it goes back to 0 at the end
- Save this new index in localStorage
- Show the name of the player corresponding to the index
- This function should be called when the roll button is pressed
- Expand the `loadSavedNames` function to set the current player as well

[Solution](/dices/part4.js)

---

# Dices: Part5, Reset 

- Create a function: `onReset` that is called when the reset button is clicked
- This function clears all text
- Clears localStorage
- Show the text `Add players`

[Solution](/dices/part5.js)

---

# Dices: Part6, Animate rolling 

- This is a difficult question, makes use of promises
- Create a function: `showRollingDice` that is called first when the roll button is clicked
  - This calls 50 times `rollDice` to create a rolling effect
  - Between every call the function has to wait 
  - The function wait the amount of ms that corresponds with how many times the function has been called
  - The first time it waits 1 ms, the last time 50 ms

---

- Tips:
  - Add `async` to the function to tell js it is an async function (do this for this function and the one that implements it)
  - Don't use `.then` you will find it when searching online for promises, but believe me don't use it here or you will hate your life
  - Put `await` before you call the function
  - use `setTimeout` to wait between the calls, combine this with a promise constructor to create a delay function
