# Exercise: Cinema

- Open the [start project](/cinema/SetupCinema.zip)
- Run `npm install` in the root of the project
- Run `npm run start` in the root of the project to spin up the server
- The html, css is already written for this project
- Complete the index.js and movie.js files to create a functioning app


---

# Overview of the app

- The app loads in all the movies from a remote server
- Displays the movies on the screen
- When clicked on a movie the details of that movie are show in a separate screen
- Th user can like a movie, the liked movies are stored in local storage

- The function will create all the elements that are required to display a movie
- Then it adds the data from the movie object in the corresponding elements
- It puts the elements together and finally shows in in the dom by adding it to the element with id: `list`
- The html of 1 movie should look like this:

```html
<a href="/movie?movieId=87849b25-febf-4086-9616-9a332c18afc8">
  <div class="movieBox">
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYzZTBhYjktZTRhOC00ZDBkLTg4Y2MtZmIwMGQwZTNiMmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjM0MTI4Mw@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1125_.jpg">
    <div>

- Create a function: `getMovieIsLikedForId` with parameter `movieId`
  - This functions returns a boolean based on if the `movieId` was in localStorage
- When the page loads in the correct functions should be called to show the icon in the correct state

# Exercise: Dices

- Open the [start project](/dices/SetupDices.zip)
- Run `npm install` in the root of the project
- Run `npm run start` in the root of the project to spin up the server
- The html, css is already written for this project
- Complete the index.js file to make it a functioning app

---

# Overview of the app

- User can click a button to roll the dices and get a random number
- The history of all the rolls is saved and shown
- Users can be added to the game
- Every time someone rolls, the next player will be set as active player

---

# Dices: Part 1, Show random dices

- Create a function: `getRandomRoll`, that return a random number from 1 to 6
- Create a function: `rollDice`
- This function gets a random number for the 2 dices and calculates the total
- It shows these values on the screen in the corresponding boxes
- Call `rollDice` when the roll button is pressed

[Solution](/dices/part1.js)

---

# Dices: Part 2, History of the rolls

- Create a function: `addResult` with result as an input
- This function creates a `p` element with the result in it and adds it to the results list element
- Create a function: `saveResult` with result as an input
- This saves the result in localStorage
- All results in localStorage are divided by a comma. Make sure this also works when localStorage is empty
- Call these function after the `rollDice` function and pass the result along
- Create a function `loadSavedResults` that is called when the page is loaded
- This functions gets the array of results from localStorage and uses `addResult` to show them to the user

[Solution](/dices/part2.js)

---

# Dices: Part3, Add names

- Create a function: `getStoredNames`
- This function gets all the names from localStorage divided by a comma and returns it as an array
- When localStorage is empty it should return an empty array
- Create a function: `onAddName` that is called when the add button is clicked
- It reads the name from the input and clears the input
- Get the other names with the `getStoredNames` function
- Add the new name to the list and save it in localStorage
- Show the names of the players in the playersText element add `Players: ` before the names and show them separated with a comma
- Create a function `loadSavedNames` that is called when the page is loaded
- This function gets the names from localStorage and displays them to the user like described above
- When there are no names the text `Add players` should be shown instead

[Solution](/dices/part3.js)

---

# Dices: Part4, Show current player

- Create a function: `showNextPlayer`
- Get the index of the current player from local storage, when there is non use 0
- Increase the index, make sure it goes back to 0 at the end
- Save this new index in localStorage
- Show the name of the player corresponding to the index
- This function should be called when the roll button is pressed
- Expand the `loadSavedNames` function to set the current player as well

[Solution](/dices/part4.js)

---

# Dices: Part5, Reset 

- Create a function: `onReset` that is called when the reset button is clicked
- This function clears all text
- Clears localStorage
- Show the text `Add players`

[Solution](/dices/part5.js)

---

# Dices: Part6, Animate rolling 

- This is a difficult question, makes use of promises
- Create a function: `showRollingDice` that is called first when the roll button is clicked
  - This calls 50 times `rollDice` to create a rolling effect
  - Between every call the function has to wait 
  - The function wait the amount of ms that corresponds with how many times the function has been called
  - The first time it waits 1 ms, the last time 50 ms

---

- Tips:
  - Add `async` to the function to tell js it is an async function (do this for this function and the one that implements it)
  - Don't use `.then` you will find it when searching online for promises, but believe me don't use it here or you will hate your life
  - Put `await` before you call the function
  - use `setTimeout` to wait between the calls, combine this with a promise constructor to create a delay function

[Solution](/dices/part6.js)

```html
<a href="/plant?plantId=77116&amp;slug=quercus-rotundifolia">
  <div class="plantBox">
    <img src="https://d2seqvvyy3b8p2.cloudfront.net/40ab8e7cdddbe3e78a581b84efa4e893.jpg"/>

[Solution](/plants/part2.js)

- Implement the like and sort buttons
- When clicked the name should toggle between two names: 
- `Show liked` <=> `Show all`  /  `Sort alphabetically` <=> `Revert sort`
- The state of the buttons should also be stored in js so we know what to change it to
- When no liked plants can be fount, the no items message should be shown as well
- When liked plants are shown, and you unlike a plant it should also be hidden
- Sort toggle between alphabetically sorted and normal order

[Solution](/plants/part4.js)

---

# Plants: Part5, Start detail page

- When clicked on the go back button, the user should go back to the previous page
- When the page loads in, the 2 search params from the url, should be set in these variables: `plantId` and `plantSlug`
- The plantSlug variable will be used in the url to fetch the correct plant
- When the data is loaded a function can be called to fill the following items with data from the call:
  - imageElement - image_url
  - plantTitleElement - common_name
  - plantScienceNameElement - scientific_name
  - plantBibliographyElement - bibliography
  - plantAuthorElement - author
  - plantObservationsElement - observations

[Solution](/plants/part5.js)

# Plants: Part6, Synonyms and Sources

- Show the names of all the synonyms on screen
- Every synonym is in it's own p element with className: `plantInfoListItem`
- Add every synonym to the plantSynonymsList

- Show the names of every source on screen
- Every source has it's own element, depending on if it has a url or not it should be `a` or `p`
- Add the url to the a elements so the link will be opened when clicked

- Add all sources to the plantSourcesList

[Solution](/plants/part6.js)

--- 

# Plants: Part7, Implement like button

- Implement the like button
- When the page is loaded the correct class should be added to the icon, based on what is in localStorage and the plantId that is passed as a search param
- When the button is clicked the class should be updated correctly as wel as the state in localStorage

[Solution](/plants/part7.js)

--- 

# Plants: Part8, Show detail images

- In the data you will find an object images whish contains keys of different parts of the plant with a list of images of that part
- To go over all keys and get the list of images for that key, you can use the following code:

```js
Object.keys(plant.images).forEach((key) => {
    const images = plant.images[key];
});
```

- In this block key is the name of the part of the plant, and images a list of objects with a link to the image 
- Implement the forEach further so we add a div with className `plantDetailImageWrapper` for every part 
- Add a h2 element to this element with the name of the part. The first letter should be a capital letter
- Underneath that there should be a div with className: `imagesList`
- In this div we can add a img element for every image with the correct link
- Every plantDetailImageWrapper should be added to the plantDetailImagesList
